# 1. Introduction to Programming (Using the C Programming Language)  

Welcome to this introduction to programming using the C programming language!  

Programming is the art and science of writing instructions for a computer to execute. What does this let us do? Just think of the myriad uses technology has in the modern world. Programming is used to create software applications like mobile apps, video games, and office software, certainly, but it is also used to create and interact with vast databases, life-saving medical technology, systems that gather analyse scientific data, and those that manage vital industries like agriculture, construction, and manufacturing.

Programmers create systems that are used to run governments and Fortune 500 companies, control city utility grids, and send rockets into space. In the modern world, computers and machines are ubiquitous and responsible for much of our growth as a society within the last century. Programmers are the people who write and maintain the code that tells all of those machines how to operate. An electronic computer is just an inert chunk of matter without programming. It can add one plus one, but only if a programmer tells it to by writing a program.
