# 1. Introduction to Programming (Using the C Programming Language)  

Welcome to this introduction to programming using the C programming language!  

Programming is the art and science of writing instructions for a computer to execute. What does this let us do? Just think of the myriad uses computer technology has in the modern world!  

Programming is used to create mobile apps, video games, and office software. It is also used to drive vast databases of information, systems that gather and analyse massive amounts of scientific data, to manage life-saving medical equipment, and systems for managing other vital industries such as agriculture, construction, and manufacturing.  

Programmers build systems that run governments and Fortune 500 companies, control city utility grids, and send rockets into space.  

Programmers are the people who write and maintain the code that keeps modern society and its systems and machines functioning.  

An electronic computer is just an inert chunk of hardware without programming. It can add one plus one, but only if a programmer tells it to do so.  

Programming is not just about building apps and launching rockets and being a cyberpunk hero. It is also about learning to think clearly and logically, solve problems systematically, and express creativity through code.
