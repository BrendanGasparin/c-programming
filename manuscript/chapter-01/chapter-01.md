# 1. Introduction to Programming (Using the C Programming Language)  

Welcome to this introduction to programming using the C programming language!  

Programming is the art and science of writing instructions for a computer to execute. What does this let us do? Just think of all the uses computer technology has in the modern world!  

Programming is used to create mobile apps, video games, and office software, obviously, but it also underlies society in less obvious ways.

Almost every aspect of human endeavour in the modern world is driven by vast databases of information and the software systems designed to interact with them. Computers and computer programs are used to further every science and industry, every frontier of human knowledge.

Programmers build systems that run governments and Fortune 500 companies, control city utility grids, and send rockets into space. They write and maintain the code that keeps modern society and its many complex moving parts interlocked and functioning.  

Programming is not just about building apps and launching rockets. It is also about learning to think clearly and logically, to solve problems systematically and efficiently, and to express function and creativity through code.
